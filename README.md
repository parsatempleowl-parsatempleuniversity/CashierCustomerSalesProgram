Goal - Mockito Testing In Java: 

This test allows me to verify that the code being tested works, regardless of its dependencies. The theory is that if the code that I write works as designed and my dependencies work as designed, then they should work together as designed. It is used to mock interfaces so that a dummy functionality can be added to a mock interface that can be used in unit testing.
